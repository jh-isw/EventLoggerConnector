# EventLoggerConnector
Get Events from the TwinCAT EventLogger


## Getting started
If you want to work with the code, rename ```Public_App.config``` to ```App.config``` and modify the ConnectionString.
Note that you need to have a local installation of TwinCAT, because the program uses the EventLogger via COM interface.
